## Introduction to Iceland

Iceland is a stunning island in the North Atlantic Ocean. Known as the "Land of Ice and Fire," Iceland is a unique country with a rich history and culture. It's home to some of the world's most spectacular natural wonders, including glaciers, volcanoes, hot springs, and waterfalls. The country is also known for its Viking heritage, which can be appreciated in the numerous museums and historical sites throughout the country.

Located between North America and Europe, Iceland is easily accessible from both continents. Reykjavik, the capital, is located on the west coast and is home to about two-thirds of the country's population.

One of Iceland's most unique features is its location in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. This gives it a unique climate, with cool summers and relatively mild winters for its latitude. In summer, Iceland experiences the phenomenon of the midnight sun, with days that can last up to 24 hours. In contrast, winters have very short days, offering excellent opportunities to see the incredible Northern Lights.

In Iceland, you can take your family on a variety of exciting adventures, from whale watching and horseback riding to glacier hikes and bathing in natural hot springs.

Whether you're looking to explore Iceland's natural wonders, learn about its history and culture, or simply relax and enjoy the stunning scenery, Iceland is a fascinating country with unique landscapes and a rich history. It's an ideal destination for families who love adventure and outdoor exploration.

## Currency and Money Exchange

The local currency in Iceland is the Icelandic króna (ISK). Credit cards are widely accepted, but it's a good idea to carry some cash for small purchases or when traveling outside of Reykjavik. There are many ATMs available throughout the country.

## Best Way to Get Around the City

The best way to explore Iceland is by car, as it gives you the freedom to explore at your own pace. There are many car rental companies available at the airport and in Reykjavik. Public transportation is also available, including buses and taxis.

The cost of a taxi from Keflavík International Airport to Reykjavik can vary depending on the taxi company, time of day, and other factors. However, as of 2023, the average cost of a taxi ride from Keflavík to Reykjavik is around 15,000 to 20,000 Icelandic króna (ISK), which is approximately 100-130 euros. It's always a good idea to confirm the price with the taxi driver before starting the journey. Alternatively, you can also take a shuttle bus or public bus, which are usually more affordable options.

> **Tip**: If you rent a car, consider getting insurance that covers damage from volcanic ash and strong winds, which are specific risks in Iceland.

## Safety Tips

Iceland is a safe country to travel in, but there are still some things to keep in mind:

1. The weather can be unpredictable, so it's important to check the forecast and dress in layers.

2. The terrain can be rugged, so wear appropriate footwear and be careful when hiking or exploring.

3. Be cautious around wildlife, including seals and puffins, and maintain a safe distance.

4. Be careful on black sand beaches, especially at Reynisfjara beach, due to the danger of sneaker waves.

5. Download the 112 Iceland app, which allows you to register your route and request emergency help if needed.

6. Always respect warning signs and safety barriers, especially near geysers, cliffs, and other dangerous natural formations.

## Gastronomy

Iceland has a unique culinary scene that offers many delicious and interesting dishes to try. Here are some of the most famous Icelandic foods that travelers should try:

1. **Skyr**: This Icelandic dairy product is similar to yogurt but has a thicker and creamier texture. It's commonly eaten as a snack or used in recipes as a healthy substitute for cream or sour cream.

Fermented shark is made by burying shark meat in the ground for several months until it becomes soft and has a strong odor. It's typically eaten in small pieces with a shot of brennivín, Iceland's national spirit.

Don't forget to check travel conditions regularly, as they can change quickly.

## Special Tips

1. If you're traveling with children, Iceland is a great destination that offers many family-friendly activities. You can visit geothermal pools, take a whale watching tour, or explore the numerous waterfalls and glaciers. However, keep in mind that some activities may not be suitable for young children and some may require advance booking, so it's important to plan accordingly.

2. Iceland can be an expensive destination, so it's a good idea to set a budget and plan accordingly. You can save money by staying in hostels or guesthouses instead of hotels, cooking your own meals instead of eating out, and taking advantage of free activities like hiking.

3. Iceland offers a variety of hot springs to visit instead of the crowded and expensive Blue Lagoon. For example, you can explore the Secret Lagoon in Fludir, which is a smaller, more natural-looking hot spring that offers a historical setting. The Mývatn Nature Baths in northern Iceland is another option, offering a similar experience to the Blue Lagoon but with fewer crowds. Alternatively, you can visit the Fontana Spa, which offers a relaxing and authentic Icelandic spa experience with a stunning view of Lake Laugarvatn.

4. Don't forget to check for updates on volcanoes. Volcanic activity is a natural part of Iceland, but it's important to stay informed for your safety.

5. Always respect the environment. Iceland is known for its pristine nature, and it's everyone's responsibility to help keep it that way. Always stay on marked trails, don't litter, and don't disturb wildlife or vegetation.

6. Book in advance, especially if you're traveling during peak season (June-August). Accommodations and popular activities can fill up quickly.

## Gifts to Buy

Iceland is known for its wool products such as sweaters, blankets, and hats. These items make excellent gifts and are widely available throughout the country. You can also find unique souvenirs like lava jewelry, handmade ceramics, and Icelandic chocolate.

## Festivals

Iceland hosts many festivals throughout the year, but one of the most popular is Reykjavik Culture Night, which takes place in August. This event offers a wide range of activities including music, dance, and food, and is a great way to experience Icelandic culture.

## Packing Recommendations

In addition to warm clothing and waterproof gear, it's a good idea to bring a reusable water bottle, as tap water in Iceland is safe to drink. It's also recommended to bring a swimsuit for the geothermal pools and hot springs.

## Health Issues

Iceland is a safe country with no major health risks. However, it's always a good idea to bring any necessary medication and travel insurance in case of emergencies.
