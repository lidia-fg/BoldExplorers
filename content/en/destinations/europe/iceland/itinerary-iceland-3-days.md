  - In summer, bring a sleep mask due to the long hours of daylight. 
  - In winter, make the most of the few hours of daylight for your activities.
- **Flexibility**: The weather in Iceland can be unpredictable. Be flexible with your itinerary and always have a plan B.
- **Respect for the environment**: 
  - Always follow marked trails and respect nature. 
  - Leave no trace in the places you visit.

Enjoy your Icelandic adventure!
