We had only 72 hours ahead of us and an ambitious list of places to visit. Can you really experience Iceland in three days?

Between steaming geysers, imposing glaciers, and the occasional child's tantrum due to fatigue, our trip to the land of ice and fire was a roller coaster of emotions and discoveries. Here we tell you how our Icelandic odyssey went and what we learned along the way.

## Day 1: Reykjavik and the Golden Circle - Where the Magic Begins

### Arrival in the Land of Eternal Light

Our journey began with a touch of nocturnal magic. We landed in Keflavík at 2 in the morning, but the midnight sun greeted us as if it were broad daylight. In Iceland, during summer, time seems to stand still thanks to its endless hours of light.

> **Bold Tip:** In summer, Iceland enjoys almost 24 hours of sunlight. Don't forget to bring a sleep mask if you want to rest properly.

> **Travel advice:** We booked with Golden Circle Taxi to get to our hotel in Reykjavik. Organizing transportation in advance is crucial to avoid unforeseen events, especially if you arrive late at night.

### Reykjavik: An Urban Rainbow

After a well-deserved rest and a breakfast where skyr (a delicious local yogurt) was the star, we set out to explore Reykjavik. This small big city is a feast for the senses:

1. **Harpa Concert Hall:** A glass building that seems straight out of a modern fairy tale. Its design, inspired by the typical basalt formations of Iceland, will leave you speechless.

2. **Hallgrímskirkja:** The imposing church that dominates Reykjavik's skyline. Climb to the tower to enjoy panoramic views of the city and the sea.

3. **Sun Voyager:** A modern sculpture that evokes a Viking ship, perfect for sunset photos by the sea.

> **Curious fact:** The houses in Reykjavik are painted in such vivid colors that they seem taken out of a box of crayons. A walk down Laugavegur will reveal endless urban art and unique shops.

### The Golden Circle: Natural Wonders at Every Stop




1. **Thingvellir National Park:** Walk literally between the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates. It's a place where history and geology merge spectacularly.
> **Fun fact:** The first parliament of Iceland, the Althing, was established here in 930 AD.

2. **Geysir Geothermal Area:** Watch as Strokkur, a geyser that erupts every 6-10 minutes, shoots hot water up to 40 meters into the air. It's a natural spectacle you won't tire of seeing.

   > **Curious fact:** The term "geyser" comes from Geysir, one of the two geysers at this site, although it is currently inactive.

3. **Gullfoss Waterfall:** Despite a light drizzle, we went down to the lower viewpoint. The roar of the waterfall and the mist in the air create an almost mystical atmosphere.

   > **Interesting history:** Gullfoss was about to become a hydroelectric plant, but thanks to the struggle of a local woman, it was preserved in its natural state.

4. **Laugarvatn Fontana Geothermal Baths:** We ended the day by immersing ourselves in these thermal waters. With temperatures between 32°C and 40°C, they are the perfect place to relax after a day of adventures.

   > **Gastronomic tip:** Don't miss the rye bread cooked with geothermal heat. It's a unique delicacy!

## Day 2: Majestic Waterfalls and Glacier Encounters

We started our second day in Solheimar, a sustainable community that has earned its reputation for its focus on social and environmental sustainability.

> **Inspiring fact:** Solheimar is a refuge for people with special needs, offering them opportunities to lead fulfilling lives while positively contributing to the community.

### Breathtaking Waterfalls

1. **Seljalandsfoss:** Famous for allowing you to walk behind it. Feeling the force of the water as it fell in front of us was an experience that left us speechless.

   > **Practical advice:** Wear waterproof clothing and shoes with good grip. You'll get wet, but every drop will be worth it.

2. **Skógafoss:** One of the most impressive waterfalls in Iceland. The 527 steps to the top are a challenge, but the panoramic views of the waterfall and the surrounding landscape are the perfect reward.

   > **Bold Tip:** Wear comfortable footwear and take your time on the climb. The views from above are worth every step.

### Sólheimajökull: An Encounter with Eternal Ice

We opted for a walk along the edge of the Sólheimajökull glacier. Seeing up close the tongues of ice mixed with volcanic ash was an almost hypnotic experience that reminded us of the strength and beauty of nature.

> **Reflection:** Standing in front of a glacier is a powerful reminder of the effects of climate change. It's a perfect moment to reflect on our impact on the planet.

### Mjólkurbúið: A Sweet Ending

To close the day, we stopped at Mjólkurbúið, a local dairy farm. Tasting their homemade ice cream while watching the cows in their natural habitat was a simple but memorable experience, especially for the little ones.

## Day 3: From the Depths of the Earth to Thermal Waters

### Raufarhólshellir: A Journey to the Center of the Earth

We started our last day exploring the Raufarhólshellir Lava Tunnel, one of the largest in Europe. Entering its caverns is like traveling to the center of the Earth, offering a unique perspective on Icelandic geology.

> **Fun fact:** The temperature inside the tunnel remains at about 4°C all year round. Bring a warm jacket, you'll need it!

> **Curious fact:** This tunnel has been the setting for several horror movies. But don't worry, during the day it's much less intimidating!

### Fagradalsfjall: Witnesses to the Earth's Force

Our next stop was the Fagradalsfjall Volcano, which erupted in 2021 after more than 800 years of inactivity. The hike to the edge was challenging, but the lunar landscape and views of the crater made every step worthwhile.

> **Exciting fact:** The volcano erupted again a week after our visit! A reminder of how alive and dynamic Iceland's geology is.

> **Bold Tip:** Always respect the signs and check volcanic alerts before venturing out. Safety is paramount when it comes to exploring active volcanic areas.

### Blue Lagoon: A Relaxing Farewell

We closed our trip at the world-famous Blue Lagoon. Immersing ourselves in its milky blue waters, applying a silica mask, and simply relaxing was the perfect way to say goodbye to Iceland.

> **Traveler's tip:** If you prefer not to bathe, you can walk around the area and admire the lunar landscape and opalescent waters without needing to enter.

> **Curious fact:** The Blue Lagoon is actually a byproduct of the Svartsengi geothermal plant. Nature and technology working together to create something beautiful!

## Final Reflections: Iceland, A Land That Changes You

With landscapes that seem from another world, adventures at every step, and a welcoming culture, Iceland is the perfect destination for an unforgettable family getaway. In just three days, we experienced erupting geysers, walked on glaciers, marveled at imposing waterfalls, and relaxed in thermal waters. Each moment reminded us of the incredible diversity and beauty of our planet.

Iceland offers a unique experience that captivates travelers of all ages, challenging us to see the world with new eyes and appreciate the strength and fragility of nature.
