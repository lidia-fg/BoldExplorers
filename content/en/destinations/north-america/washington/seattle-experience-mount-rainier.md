# A Family Day at Mount Rainier: Snow Adventure in the Middle of July

Hello everyone! We want to share with you our recent adventure in Mount Rainier National Park. If you're thinking about visiting, here's our experience!

We left West Seattle early to avoid traffic. After a two-hour journey full of anticipation, we arrived at the park entrance. Practical tip: you can enter with the U.S. National Parks annual pass or pay the daily entrance fee. We used our annual pass and entered without any issues.

Our first stop was Longmire. There we did the Trail of the Shadows, a short walk of about 0.7 miles. It's perfect for stretching your legs after the car ride. We saw old cabins and even tasted spring water. We finished in 30-40 minutes, but it was worth it.

Then we went to Paradise, and we assure you the name does it justice. From there we started the Skyline Trail Loop. And here comes the most fun part: our kids started playing with snow in the middle of July! Imagine, throwing snowballs with the imposing Mount Rainier in the background. It was a surreal and very fun moment.

We had planned to do the Grove of the Patriarchs trail, which has a suspension bridge that looked very interesting. Unfortunately, it was closed due to damage. So we already have an excuse to come back, right?

By the end of the day, we were quite tired and didn't make it to the Sunrise area. We've heard the views from there are impressive, so that's another reason to return.

Some things we learned:
- Mount Rainier is an active volcano, although dormant. It's impressive to see it up close!
- It has more glaciers than any other mountain in the continental U.S.
- The weather can change quickly, so go prepared with warm clothes.

In summary, our day at Mount Rainier was a mix of hikes, laughter, unexpected snow, and incredible landscapes. If you like nature and adventure, we recommend you visit. It's a place you won't forget.
