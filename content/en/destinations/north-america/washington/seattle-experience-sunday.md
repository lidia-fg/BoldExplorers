# Discovering Seattle as a Family: Our Sunday Adventure

Traveling families, we're excited to share our experience with you! Recently, we took advantage of a sunny Sunday to explore the outskirts of Seattle with our little ones. It was a day full of discoveries that we want to share with you.

Our day began early, leaving behind the bustle of Seattle to head east. Our first destination: the majestic Snoqualmie Falls.

## Snoqualmie Falls: A Natural and Technological Wonder

When we arrived at Snoqualmie Falls, we were amazed. At 82 meters high, it surpasses the famous Niagara Falls. But what really caught our attention was how these falls are not just a natural spectacle, but also a fascinating example of sustainable engineering.

The Snoqualmie hydroelectric plant, skillfully camouflaged in the environment, harnesses the power of water to generate electricity. It works like this: the water from the falls is partially diverted through pipes to underground turbines. These turbines, as they spin, produce clean energy that supplies thousands of homes in the region.

The interesting thing is that this process doesn't significantly alter the flow of the falls. In fact, during our visit, we could observe how the water continued to fall majestically, while beneath our feet, nature and technology worked in harmony.

For the kids, it was a practical lesson on renewable energy. We explained to them how the water they saw falling was converted into the light we use at home. Their faces of wonder were priceless.

## From Japan to the Heights

Our next stop was unexpected: a Japanese fair in Bellevue. Inside the Convention Palace, the aroma from the food stalls immediately attracted us and we felt transported to Osaka. We couldn't resist trying some Takoyaki, octopus balls that delighted both adults and children.

Afterwards, we headed to Rattlesnake Ledge for a family hike. The 4-mile trail was a challenge (and not just for the little ones!), but the views from the top more than made up for it.

At the summit, we ate the sandwiches we had brought with us and they tasted exquisite. We observed Rattlesnake Lake, the lush forests, and the distant silhouettes of Mount Si and Mount Washington. We enjoyed a picnic at the top, an experience our children will surely remember for a long time.

## Unexpected Discoveries

Our adventure continued in the charming town of Issaquah. Its picturesque streets and welcoming atmosphere reminded us of typical American movies. It was a pleasant contrast to the nature we had experienced earlier.

Then we visited Magus Books, near the University of Washington. This second-hand bookstore turned out to be a treasure trove for the whole family. Our children were excited exploring books from all eras and subjects. We found a Beethoven booklet that we bought for grandma, as he's her favorite composer.

## A Perfect Ending at Gas Works Park

We ended our day at Gas Works Park, a fascinating example of how an industrial space can be transformed into a recreational area. This park, opened in 1975, was built on the site of a former coal gasification plant. The designers decided to keep part of the original machinery, turning it into unique industrial sculptures that are now an integral part of the park's landscape.

While the kids ran around on the grass, we enjoyed a spectacular view of Seattle's skyline reflecting in Lake Union. We saw many people paddleboarding on the lake. To us, it looked like the waters were frozen!
