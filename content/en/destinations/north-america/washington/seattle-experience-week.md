Hello, traveling families! Today we want to share with you our exciting weekday adventures in Seattle. This city surprised us with its perfect blend of history, culture, and modernity, offering unique experiences for the whole family.

An important detail: during our stay, our children were homeschooling in the mornings while my husband worked, so we took advantage of the afternoons to explore the city. Here are some ideas to keep in mind for your visit to Seattle, especially if you're combining education and tourism.

**Fun Fact:** Did you know that Seattle is known as the "Emerald City" because of its lush evergreen forests?

## Pike Place Market: A Feast for the Senses

Our first stop was the iconic Pike Place Market. What a fascinating experience for the kids! The aroma of freshly brewed coffee mixed with the salty sea air, creating a unique atmosphere. The stalls full of colorful flowers and fresh fish captured everyone's attention.

The most fun for the little ones (and for us!) was watching the famous fish-throwing show. The vendors throw huge salmon from one side of the stall to the other, a tradition that has become a symbol of Seattle!

Also, we bought some mini donuts from a machine near the stall that were delicious. A sweet memory of our visit!

**Interesting Fact:** Pike Place Market, opened in 1907, is one of the oldest continuously operated public farmers' markets in the United States.

**Tip for parents:** Arrive early to avoid crowds and enjoy breakfast with fresh produce from the market. It's an excellent way to start the day before morning classes.

## The Origin of Starbucks and a Peculiar Alley

Right across from the market, we found the first Starbucks store. Although the line was long, the experience of having a coffee where it all began can be interesting if you don't mind waiting. The kids had fun looking for differences between this original Starbucks and the ones they usually see.

**Fun Fact:** The original Starbucks logo was brown and featured a twin-tailed mermaid, or siren, encircled by the store's name.

We chose to have our coffee at Ghost Alley Espresso, a charming cafe located right at the beginning of the famous Gum Wall. Imagine the surprise of the kids seeing not just a wall but an entire alley completely covered with chewed gum turned into a kind of colorful mural!

**Fun fact for the little ones:** The Gum Wall started as an act of vandalism and is now a tourist attraction. A fun lesson on how art can emerge in the most unexpected places!

**Interesting Fact:** The Gum Wall was named one of the germiest tourist attractions in 2009, second only to the Blarney Stone in Ireland.

## A Journey through History and Culture

Another afternoon, we explored Chinatown, where the Uwajimaya market offered us a fascinating cultural experience. The kids were excited to try Asian snacks they had never seen before, and of course, we stocked up on very interesting products for our dinners that week. It was an excellent way to complement their lessons on cultural diversity and remember our trip to Japan.

**Fun Fact:** Seattle's Chinatown is officially known as the Chinatown-International District and is one of the most diverse neighborhoods in the city, home to Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Filipino communities.

In Pioneer Square, the historic heart of Seattle, there's the Underground Tour. Although we didn't take the tour, we walked around the city observing the glass panes in the ground, knowing that the underground streets are below. It's fascinating to learn how, after the great fire of 1889, the city was literally rebuilt on top of itself, raising the street level. This historical fact offers an excellent opportunity to teach children about resilience and urban planning.

**Interesting Fact:** The decision to rebuild Seattle one story higher was not just about fire prevention, but also to solve the city's sewage problems, which had become quite severe due to the tides.

## Flying High at the Museum of Flight

The Museum of Flight was one of the children's favorites. Seeing planes from all eras and learning about the history of aviation was exciting. The flight simulators were a huge hit, and we even wrote letters that they told us would go to the moon and come back to us.

The museum has many activities for children to enjoy the planes, have hands-on experiences, and learn while playing. It was an excellent way to complement science and history lessons.

**Fun Fact:** The Museum of Flight houses the first Air Force One jet, which served presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon.

**Tip:** Plan to spend at least half a day here. There's a lot to see and do, especially for curious kids.

## An Escape to Bainbridge Island

We took the ferry to Bainbridge Island, an experience in itself. The view of the Seattle skyline from the water is impressive. The ferry to Bainbridge Island departs from the Seattle Ferry Terminal (Colman Dock), located at 801 Alaskan Way, on the downtown Seattle waterfront. It's within walking distance of attractions like Pike Place Market and Pioneer Square. The ferry ride offers beautiful views of the Seattle skyline and takes about 35 minutes to reach Bainbridge Island.

On the island, we strolled through the charming downtown Winslow, full of shops and art galleries.

**Interesting Fact:** Bainbridge Island was named the second-best place to live in the United States by CNN/Money in 2005, known for its rural character and easy access to Seattle.

**Idea for families:** Bring a picnic to enjoy in one of the island's parks. It's an excellent way to relax after the morning's educational activities.

## Unusual Encounters and Relaxing Moments

We couldn't leave without visiting the Fremont Troll, a giant sculpture under a bridge that fascinates both young and old. It's the perfect place for a fun family photo! Afterwards, you can walk around the area, which is very bohemian and artistic, full of galleries, cafes, and quirky shops.

**Fun Fact:** The Fremont Troll was created in 1990 as part of a competition to rehabilitate the area under the bridge, which had become a dumping ground and haven for drug dealers.

We spent our last afternoon at Alki Beach, the perfect place to relax after so many adventures. We took a walk on the sand and enjoyed the views of the city.

On the promenade of this beach, there are shows, people dancing, and a very nice atmosphere for a walk. It's an excellent place for children to relax after their educational activities and explore a bit of local culture.

**Interesting Fact:** Alki Beach is the site where the first white settlers landed in Seattle in 1851, and a miniature Statue of Liberty stands on the beach to commemorate this event.

These weekday adventures in Seattle showed us a city full of surprises, perfect for exploring as a family while combining education and tourism. Each day brought new experiences and memories that we will treasure, and learning opportunities that perfectly complemented our children's homeschooling.
